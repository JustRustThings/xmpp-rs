xmpp-rs
=======

What's this?
------------

A very much WIP rust XMPP library with the goals of being type-safe, well-tested and simple.

Can I use it yet?
-----------------

No, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done before this could be used for anything.

What license is it under?
-------------------------

LGPLv3, see `COPYING` and `COPYING.LESSER`.
