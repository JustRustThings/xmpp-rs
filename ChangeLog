Version 0.12.0:
2018-09-20  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Breaking changes:
        - Update dependencies.
        - Switch to git, upstream is now available at
          https://gitlab.com/xmpp-rs/xmpp-parsers
        - Switch to Edition 2018, this removes support for rustc
          versions older than 1.31.
        - Implement support for XEP-0030 2.5rc3, relaxing the ordering
          of children in disco#info.
    * Improvements:
        - Test for struct size, to keep them known and avoid bloat.
        - Add various constructors to make the API easier to use.
        - Reexport Jid from the jid crate, to avoid any weird issue on
          using different incompatible versions of the same crate.
        - Add forgotten 'ask' attribute on roster item (thanks O01eg!).
        - Use cargo-fmt on the codebase, to lower the barrier of entry.
        - Add a disable-validation feature, disabling many checks
          xmpp-parsers is doing.  This should be used for software
          which want to let invalid XMPP pass through instead of being
          rejected as invalid (thanks Astro-!).

Version 0.11.1:
2018-09-20  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Improvements:

        - Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060) now supports requests in
          addition to events.
    * Breaking changes:
        - Switch from std::error to failure to report better errors.
        - Bump to minidom 0.9.1, and reexport minidom::Element.
    * Improvements:
        - Add getters for the best body and subject in message, to make
          it easier to determine which one the user wants based on
          their language preferences.
        - Add constructors and setters for most Jingle elements, to
          ease their creation.

Version 0.9.0:
2017-10-31  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Blocking Command (XEP-0191) has been added.
        - Date and Time Profiles (XEP-0082) has been added, replacing

    * Breaking changes:
        - Fix subscription="none" not being the default.
        - Add more type safety to pubsub#event.
        - Reuse Jingle’s ContentId type in JingleFT.

        - Check for children ordering in disco#info result.
        - Finish implementation of <received/>, <checksum/> and
          <range/> in JingleFT.
        - Correctly serialise <ping/>, and test it.

Version 0.8.0:
2017-08-27  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - iq:version (XEP-0092) has been added.
        - Finally implement extension serialisation in disco.
    * Breaking changes:
        - Wrap even more elements into their own type, in jingle,
          jingle_ft, roster, message.
        - Split loose enums into multiple structs where it makes sense,
          such as for IBB, StanzaId, Receipts.
        - Split disco query and answer elements into their own struct,
          to enforce more guarantees on both.
    * Improvements:
        - Use Vec::into_iter() more to avoid references and clones.
        - Make data_forms propagate a media_element error.
        - Document more of disco, roster, chatstates.

Version 0.7.1:
2017-07-24  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Hotfixes:
        - Stub out blake2 support, since the blake2 crate broke its API
          between their 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 releases…

Version 0.7.0:
2017-07-23  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Jingle Message Initialisation (XEP-0353) was added.
        - The disco#items query (XEP-0030) is now supported, in
          addition to the existing disco#info one.
    * Breaking changes:
        - Replaced many type aliases with proper wrapping structs.
        - Split Disco into a query and a result part, since they have
          very different constraints.
        - Split IqPayload in three to avoid parsing queries as results
          for example.
    * Improvements:
        - Use TryFrom from the try_from crate, thus removing the
          dependency on nightly!
        - Always implement From instead of Into, the latter is
          generated anyway.
        - Add helpers to construct your Presence stanza.

Version 0.6.0:
2017-06-27  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - In-Band Registration (XEP-0077) was added.
        - Multi-User Chat (XEP-0045) got expanded a lot, thanks pep.!
    * Breaking changes:
        - Added wrappers for Strings used as identifiers, to add type
          safety.
        - Use chrono’s DateTime for JingleFT’s date element.
        - Use Jid for JingleS5B’s jid attribute.
    * Improvements:
        - Use more macros for common tasks.
        - Add a constructor for Message and Presence.
        - Implement std::fmt::Display and std::error::Error on our
          error type.
        - Fix DataForms serialisation.
        - Fix roster group serialisation.
        - Update libraries, notably chrono whose version 0.3.1 got
          yanked.

Version 0.5.0:
2017-06-11  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Implementation of the roster management protocol defined in
          RFC 6121 §2.
        - Implementation of PubSub events (except collections).
        - Early implementation of MUC.
    * Breaking changes:
        - Rename presence enums to make them easier to use.
    * Improvements:
        - Make hashes comparable and hashable.
        - Make data forms embeddable easily into minidom
          Element::builder.

Version 0.4.0:
2017-05-28  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Incompatible changes:
        - Receipts now make the id optional, as per the specification.
        - Hashes now expose their raw binary value, instead of staying
          base64-encoded.
        - Parse dates (XEP-0082) in delayed delivery (XEP-0203) and
          last user interaction (XEP-0319), using the chrono crate.
    * Improvements:
        - Removal of most of the remaining clones, the only ones left
          are due to minidom not exposing a draining iterator over the
          children.
        - Finish to parse all of the attributes using get_attr!().
        - More attribute checks.
        - Split more parsers into one parser per element.
        - Rely on minidom 0.4.3 to serialise more standard types
          automatically.
        - Implement forgotten serialisation for data forms (XEP-0004).
        - Implement legacy capabilities (XEP-0115) for compatibility
          with older software.

Version 0.3.0:
2017-05-23  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Big changes:
        - All parsers and serialisers now consume their argument, this
          makes the API way more efficient, but you will have to clone
          before passing your structs in it if you want to keep them.
        - Payloads of stanzas are not parsed automatically anymore, to
          let applications which want to forward them as-is do so more
          easily.  Parsing now always succeeds on unknown payloads, it
          just puts them into an Unknown value containing the existing
          minidom Element.
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Last User Interaction in Presence, XEP-0319.
    * Improved parsers/serialisers:
        - Message now supports subject, bodies and threads as per
          RFC 6121 §5.2.
        - Replace most attribute reads with a nice macro.
        - Use enums for more enum-like things, for example Algo in
          Hash, or FieldType in DataForm.
        - Wire up stanza-id and origin-id to MessagePayload.
        - Wire up MAM elements to message and iq payloads.
        - Changes in the RSM API.
        - Add support for more data forms elements, but still not the
          complete set.
        - Thanks to minidom 0.3.1, check for explicitly disallowed
          extra attributes in some elements.
    * Crate updates:
        - minidom 0.4.1

Version 0.2.0:
2017-05-06  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Stanza error, as per RFC 6120 §8.3.
        - Jingle SOCKS5 Transport, XEP-0260.
    * Incompatible changes:
        - Parsers and serialisers now all implement TryFrom<Element>
          and Into<Element>, instead of the old parse_* and serialise_*
          functions.
        - Presence has got an overhaul, it now hosts show, statuses and
          priority in its struct.  The status module has also been
          dropped.
        - Message now supports multiple bodies, each in a different
          language.  The body module has also been dropped.
        - Iq now gets a proper StanzaError when the type is error.
        - Fix bogus Jingle payload, which was requiring both
          description and transport.
    * Crate updates:
        - minidom 0.3.0

Version 0.1.0:
2017-04-29  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Implement many extensions.
