Version 0.3.0:
2017-05-23  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Big changes:
        - All parsers and serialisers now consume their argument, this
          makes the API way more efficient, but you will have to clone
          before passing your structs in it if you want to keep them.
        - Payloads of stanzas are not parsed automatically anymore, to
          let applications which want to forward them as-is do so more
          easily.  Parsing now always succeeds on unknown payloads, it
          just puts them into an Unknown value containing the existing
          minidom Element.
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Last User Interaction in Presence, XEP-0319.
    * Improved parsers/serialisers:
        - Message now supports subject, bodies and threads as per
          RFC 6121 §5.2.
        - Replace most attribute reads with a nice macro.
        - Use enums for more enum-like things, for example Algo in
          Hash, or FieldType in DataForm.
        - Wire up stanza-id and origin-id to MessagePayload.
        - Wire up MAM elements to message and iq payloads.
        - Changes in the RSM API.
        - Add support for more data forms elements, but still not the
          complete set.
        - Thanks to minidom 0.3.1, check for explicitly disallowed
          extra attributes in some elements.
    * Crate updates:
        - minidom 0.4.1

Version 0.2.0:
2017-05-06  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Stanza error, as per RFC 6120 §8.3.
        - Jingle SOCKS5 Transport, XEP-0260.
    * Incompatible changes:
        - Parsers and serialisers now all implement TryFrom<Element>
          and Into<Element>, instead of the old parse_* and serialise_*
          functions.
        - Presence has got an overhaul, it now hosts show, statuses and
          priority in its struct.  The status module has also been
          dropped.
        - Message now supports multiple bodies, each in a different
          language.  The body module has also been dropped.
        - Iq now gets a proper StanzaError when the type is error.
        - Fix bogus Jingle payload, which was requiring both
          description and transport.
    * Crate updates:
        - minidom 0.3.0

Version 0.1.0:
