Version 0.2.0:
2017-05-06  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * New parsers/serialisers:
        - Stanza error, as per RFC 6120 §8.3.
        - Jingle SOCKS5 Transport, XEP-0260.
    * Incompatible changes:
        - Parsers and serialisers now all implement TryFrom<Element>
          and Into<Element>, instead of the old parse_* and serialise_*
          functions.
        - Presence has got an overhaul, it now hosts show, statuses and
          priority in its struct.  The status module has also been
          dropped.
        - Message now supports multiple bodies, each in a different
          language.  The body module has also been dropped.
        - Iq now gets a proper StanzaError when the type is error.
        - Fix bogus Jingle payload, which was requiring both
          description and transport.
    * Crate updates:
        - minidom 0.3.0

Version 0.1.0:
